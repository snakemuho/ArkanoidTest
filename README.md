## ðŸŽ® **Gameplay Overview**

In this game:
- The platform is controlled with left and right screen buttons.

## ðŸ”§ **Features**

### 1. **Dynamic Bricks Generation**
- Levels are generated dynamically, defined by `LevelSettings` ScriptableObjects located in `Assets/Settings`
- This ScriptableObject stores the brick types to spawn and their spawn chance, the number of generated rows and columns, spacing between the bricks, start Y position and possible random brick colors.

### 2. **Bricks**
- New brick types can be created by inheriting from the `Brick` abstract class.

### 3. **Powerups**
- Like with bricks, new powerup types can be created by inheriting from the `Powerup` abstract class.
